Along with Paxman, the programmes regular presenters are Kirsty Wark, Gavin Esler, and Emily Maitlis.\n\nNewsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially significant event in the news - as happened on 7 July 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended programme which continued until 11:35 pm. Recent editions are available to view and download for a limited time through the BBC iPlayer. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.",
